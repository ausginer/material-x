# Button groups — Material 3 Expressive spec consistency

Review of `mx-button-group` (standard) and `mx-connected-button-group` (connected) against the Material Design 3 **Expressive** button-group spec.

- **Spec reference:** <https://m3.material.io/components/button-groups/specs> (read 2026-06-20)
- **Implementation under test:** Storybook at `http://localhost:6006` (`Button Group/Standard` and `Button Group/Connected` stories)
- **Method:** live DOM measurement of the rendered group + child buttons (computed `gap`, `border-radius`, custom-property values, custom-state matching) compared against the M3 spec tables, plus inspection of the **compiled** CSS via `npx just debug <file>.css.ts` and the component wiring under `button-group/`.

> Theme note: the running Storybook uses a custom **green** palette. Group components have no color of their own (see below), so this does not affect the comparison.

## Summary

Structure, variants, sizing model, connected corner morphing, and the standard press interaction are all consistent with M3 Expressive.

1. **~~The group host never receives its own size custom-state~~ — FIXED (2026-07-12).** Previously the group's per-size tokens (`between-space`, `inner-corner.corner-size`) never applied, so every standard group rendered with the _small_ spacing and connected L/XL rendered with the _small_ inner-corner radius. `useButtonGroupCore` (`ButtonGroupCore.ts`) now mirrors `size` onto the host as a custom state via `switchState`, activating the `:host(:state(<size>))` rules. Covered by `test/button-group/button-group.spec.browser.test.ts` (between-space + inner-corner per size) and the host-size-state behavior tests.
2. (Minor, **not a bug in this repo**) The connected **XS inner-corner** resolves to `8px`, where the spec's _measurement diagram_ says `4dp`. This is an **upstream contradiction**: M3's own token table defines the value as 8dp, so the implementation is token-faithful.

## What matches the spec ✅

### Variants & configuration

| Aspect | Spec (M3 Expressive) | Implementation | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Standard button group | Available | `mx-button-group` | ✅ |
| Connected button group | Available | `mx-connected-button-group` | ✅ |
| Sizes | XS, S, M, L, XL | `size` = xsmall / small / medium / large / xlarge | ✅ |
| Shapes | Round, square | `shape` = round / square (forwarded to buttons) | ✅ |
| Selection | Single / multi-select | group `value` + `mx-switch-button` / `mx-switch-icon-button` | ✅ |
| Color | Group has no color; uses button color styles | Group is an invisible container; `color` is forwarded to child buttons via context | ✅ |

### Connected group — padding & corner morphing (measured)

- **Between-space (gap):** `2px` at every size ✅ (spec: 2dp at every size).
- **Outer corners full, inner corners square:** child buttons render asymmetric radii — e.g. first button `20px 8px 8px 20px`, last `8px 20px 20px 8px` (S) — matching the "outer fully round, inner square" model ✅.
- **Selection/press morph:** `::slotted(:active)` and `::slotted([checked])` reset the pressed/selected button's inner corners to the full container shape, and the morph does **not** affect adjacent buttons ✅ (matches "connected groups only affect the shape of the button being selected/activated").

### Standard group — press interaction (verified in source)

Spec: "pressing a button changes its width, shape, and padding, which adjusts the width of buttons directly next to it." Implementation matches:

- On `pointerdown`, `button-group.ts` sets `--_interaction-direction-leading/` `trailing = -1` on the **neighbours** (shrinking their padding), while the pressed button's own `::slotted(:active)` rule sets `+1` (growing its padding), scaled by `--_interaction-width-multiplier` (`0.15` = the spec's 15%). ✅
- The pressed **shape** morph is handled by the button itself (`:active` corner morph, verified in the button review). ✅

### Standard between-space — token values (compiled CSS)

The compiled `:host(:state(<size>))` rules carry the correct spec values (XS 18 · S 12 · M/L/XL 8). They are simply never activated at runtime — see delta 1.

## Deltas / gaps ⚠️

### 1. Group host never gets its own size custom-state (root cause) — FIXED

> Resolved 2026-07-12: `useButtonGroupCore` now calls `switchState` for `size` on the group host, so the per-size `:host(:state(<size>))` rules activate. The description below is retained for context.

- **Symptom (measured):**
  - **Standard `between-space`** is `12px` for **all five sizes** (XS, S, M, L, XL). Spec: XS **18** · S **12** · M **8** · L **8** · XL **8** dp. Only `small` happens to be correct because 12px is the default.
  - **Connected `inner-corner.corner-size`** is `8px` for **all five sizes**. Spec (round): XS 4 · S 8 · M 8 · L **16** · XL **20** dp — so **L and XL are wrong** (stuck at 8px), while S/M match the default by coincidence.
- **Confirmation:** `group.matches(':state(xlarge)')` returns **`false`** for a `size="xlarge"` group; `getPropertyValue('--_inner-corner-corner-size')` reads `8px` (the base `:host` default) instead of `20px`.
- **Cause:** `button-group-context.ts` → `useButtonGroupProvider` only forwards attribute changes to child buttons (`emitter.emit(...)`); it never calls `switchState` on the group host. `useButtonGroupCore` (`ButtonGroupCore.ts`) likewise does not wire `size`/`shape` to a custom state on the group (unlike `useButtonCore`, which does). As a result every `:host(:state(xsmall|medium|large|xlarge))` rule in `styles/standard/*` and `styles/connected/*` is dead.
- **Why sizes still look different:** the size is delivered to the **child buttons** through the context provider, so button heights/shapes change; only the **group-level** spacing/corners are stuck.

### 2. Connected XS inner-corner value — upstream contradiction (not a repo bug)

- The compiled `:host(:state(xsmall))` for the connected group sets `--_inner-corner-corner-size: 8px`, but the spec's "Measurements → Connected button group" _diagram_ lists **XS: 4dp**.
- **Verified against the token DB** (`use-tokens-db`): `md.comp.button-group.connected.xsmall.inner-corner.corner-size` resolves to **8 DIPS**, aliased to `md.sys.shape.corner-value.small`. The implementation faithfully follows the upstream token table; the **4dp** figure only appears in the spec's measurement diagram.
- Full upstream chain (token table): XS 8 (`corner-value.small`) · S 8 · M 8 · L 16 (`corner-value.large`) · XL 20 (`corner-value.large-increased`). S/M/L/XL agree with both the diagram and the token table; only XS disagrees, and the disagreement is between two M3 sources, not a coding error here.
- Independent of delta 1 (even with the size-state applied, XS renders `8px` by the token).

## Could not fully verify

- Exact per-size **container heights** of the group are driven entirely by the child buttons (the group is an invisible container), so they were not measured separately — they inherit the button heights already validated in the button review.
- The spec's interactive **token tables** (for the connected XS corner value) were not machine-readable in this pass; delta 2 is based on the spec's measurement diagram text.

## Suggested follow-ups

1. ~~Apply the group's own size as a custom-state on the host~~ **Done (2026-07-12)** — `useButtonGroupCore` mirrors `size` onto the host via `switchState`, activating the per-size `between-space` and `inner-corner.corner-size` rules for both standard and connected groups. Only `size` is wired: the compiled group styles key exclusively on `:host(:state(<size>))`; `shape` is forwarded to child buttons and needs no group-host state.
2. No action needed for the connected **XS inner-corner** in this repo — the value tracks the upstream token (8dp). If pixel-matching the spec diagram's 4dp is desired, it would be an intentional override of the M3 token, and ideally reported upstream as a token-vs-diagram inconsistency.
