# `@ydinjs/drag` record: decisions

The register for scope `drag`, under `repo:RD-1`: decisions are `DRD-n`, invariants `DRI-n`, owner decisions `DRO-n`. Numbering starts at 1. drag2's bare `D-` series is separate. To read one entry:

```sh
awk -v re="^#### DRD-1( —|$)" \
  '$0 ~ re {f=1;print;next} f && /^#{1,4} /{exit} f' \
  packages/drag/.plan/00-index.md
```

**Input:** the prototype read at `26f82fbb1`. That commit is on no ref now. Its `packages/drag` tree is byte-identical to `599684791` on `drag/prototype`, so later citations use `599684791`. Evidence: [`prototype-report.md`](prototype-report.md), [`probes/prototype/`](probes/prototype/README.md), [`probes/final-design/`](probes/final-design/README.md). The comparison and earlier evidence are in [`architecture-plan.md`](architecture-plan.md).

**Status, 2026-11-07:** production was built at `d7e7b0d3a` on `drag/production` and reviewed twice at that commit: a [review round](reviews/production/production-summary.md) and an [architecture challenge](reviews/architecture/production-design-challenge.md). `DRD-14` to `DRD-23` decide every finding and question from both. Where they change an earlier decision, its status row names the amendment. The required behavior is in [`contract.md`](contract.md). The [remediation](remediation-report.md) implemented them at `b91db2818`, and no independent review has read it yet. The owner's composition refactor at `3084191bb` and the implementer's findings on it are decided by `DRD-24` and `DRD-25`. The next step is [`composition-handoff.md`](composition-handoff.md). Its built-in item can start, and its kernel item waits for the probe that `DRD-24` defines.

**Neither the prototype's approval nor the 2026-11-06 reading established a performance result.** `DRD-13` and `DRD-22` say what does.

## Decisions

#### DRD-1 — Single-pass control

**One `Session` record, with idle as its absence. `#running` refuses a nested pass, and one reader applies requests between steps, with precedence destroy, deferred steps, decision, next step.**

Foreign code runs synchronously inside DOM writes, and the independent model's commit order failed there (architecture plan §3). The prototype held this through the public API in three engines, in 10 scenarios. One decision slot replaces three because the first of cancel, fault and verdict always wins. FIFO between kinds of request is rejected. The two booleans `concluded` and `released` are accepted: nothing reads them as a phase, and the implementer may remove them.

#### DRD-2 — One public authoring API

**`draggable` is public, and `sortable` and `freeDrag` use only its public values and types. A behavior never receives the session. Extension is by whole behavior. No third-party `axis` or plugin seam is published.**

Owner requirement, with possible Readymag use. The prototype showed no private kernel path was needed, and `Drag` has no reference to the session. Its additions are accepted: `command`, `handle` with `data-drag-ignore`, `settle` returning timing, `panel.use`, and `onEnd` carrying `request`. An axis seam stays out because no example wanted one, and adding it later breaks nothing. `createFrameTask`, `listenForInvalidation` and the landing policy stay private (CONTRIBUTING §4), because a behavior can write each in a few lines. A kernel frame hook is rejected for the same reason: every composition would pay for it.

#### DRD-3 — Faults through `reportError`

**`onError` is removed. Every report is one `DragFault`, sent through the library realm's `reportError` when caught, with `cause` by identity. The decision slot is filled before the report.**

Owner requirement. Eight hostile values and both listener cases passed in three engines. The fault's message keeps the original's text, because `event.message` omits `cause`. How each engine's DevTools prints `cause` is still unobserved, and that can change only the message wording. No step or root field is added.

#### DRD-4 — The lift is an imported value

**`lift` replaces `lift: false`. With no `lift` key, the bundle has no `presentation` or `box-quad` code from the kernel. `startLanding` and the lift's view fields belong to the lift module, and their types appear only when `lift` is composed.**

`presentation` and `box-quad` are 4,389 of `draggable`'s 10,119 minified bytes, and a no-lift behavior never runs them (report §Size). A boolean can't be shaken, so the prototype's design violates CONTRIBUTING §7. A value also fixes the report's type defect, where `rect` was non-null but unset. **Cost:** one more export and one more import for a lifted custom behavior. `draggable` alone should fall to about 5.7 KB minified, **estimated**.

#### DRD-5 — `box-quad` is the one coordinate model

**Behaviors with and without the lift use `Space`, `Box` and a new `localDelta` from `@ydinjs/box-quad`. `InheritedSpace` and the canvas example's size ratio are removed. A no-lift behavior imports `box-quad` itself and pays only for what it uses. Recorded in that package as `box-quad:BQ-10`.**

Owner requirement. Both linear parts sit in the same four slots, so one pure function serves both. A throwaway function with this signature gave zero error across rotate, scale, skew, zoom, own rotate and resize, in three engines ([results](probes/final-design/results.json.txt)). The one miss was the element's own `zoom`, which a `Space` excludes by definition, and DRI-16 states it. The kernel does not read a basis for a no-lift behavior: which element and which basis are the behavior's knowledge, and a resize handle in an untransformed page should not pay for an ancestor walk.

#### DRD-6 — `requestStep` replaces `run`, `requestApply` and `apply`

**One request runs behavior code in a pass: at once when idle of a pass, between steps otherwise. The step receives the `Drag` only while the operation is active and undecided, and `null` otherwise. Hooks also get `drag.requestStep` and `drag.requestCancel`.**

This resolves four difficulties in the report. `run` was refused silently inside a pass. `requestApply` needed a holding variable outside the drag. Both built-ins wrote the same `released` flag. Hooks named a controller declared after them, the source of the 8 `no-use-before-define` errors. It also fixes the `moveTo` defect, where a write behind a cancel moved the visual and the landing's start.

**This is a short list, and it does not bring back the queue.** It holds only steps, on one precedence level, and is empty on the hot path. Destruction and the decision remain slots, nothing is tagged or reordered, and no pointer sample enters it. **I withdraw the plan's "the kernel grows a queue" stop condition for this one list.** The condition's concern, a second reader or FIFO across kinds, still holds as a stop condition. Identity coalescing keeps change 5, where two `invalidate()` calls pull once. A cancel followed by `invalidate()` no longer pulls first, which removes the report's one visible FIFO difference.

The rule that an author must not write directly from foreign code stays a documented rule. Nothing can detect a violation.

#### DRD-7 — A disposer receives the outcome

**`drag.use` disposers receive the `Outcome`, or `null` on destruction. A late `use`, on an operation or a controller, runs at once.**

Rollback had to live in `use` because `end` doesn't run on destruction, and `use` couldn't see the outcome, so the canvas example needed a flag set in `settle`. With the argument, one disposer states the rollback. **This answers open question 5: destruction with no `end` stays,** and the cost it showed is removed.

#### DRD-8 — The click guard outlives destruction

**DRI-11 wins over "all listeners are gone" in DRI-10. The guard stays until it expires, holds no reference to the item or controller, and also expires at the next primary press.**

The defect ran: destroying with the button held delivered the trailing click in all three engines ([results](probes/final-design/results.json.txt)). A stray click is a user-visible effect, and a guard bounded by one gesture runs no consumer code. The new press expiry keeps "no later click is swallowed" when a release never reaches the window. It costs one more listener in the guard.

#### DRD-9 — The kernel keeps focus through an operation

**DRI-12. Implemented in the kernel and the lift, so every behavior gets it with no code. Not on destruction. It never takes focus from an element focused since the drop.**

The probe showed focus goes to `body` after keyboard and pointer reorders in all three engines, and `insertBefore`, which the API encourages, causes it. A second arrow press then does nothing, so keyboard reordering fails unless a consumer repairs it. The lift also moved focus to an `autofocus` descendant in all three engines. **This narrows the "no focus management" boundary in `accessibility.md`** for the new package: the consumer still owns `tabindex`, roles and announcements. Restoring in the consumer would leave a defect in the documented example.

#### DRD-10 — Landing elevation by animation

**The flight animates `z-index` and, for a static item, `position`, in a separate replacing animation. Presentation is still released before the landing and terminal. Reduced motion moves into the lift, so it covers every behavior.**

Results, in three engines: with elevation the item stayed on top of `relative` and `z-index: 5` siblings, and left no inline style. **One additive animation is rejected:** in WebKit, adding to the item's own `z-index: 5` wrapped it to `-2147483648` and the item went under.

**Holding the top layer for the flight is rejected, and `drag:DRO-2` keeps it open as the alternative.** It would fix clipping as well. But a consumer's `insertBefore` already closes the popover in all three engines, so an accepted reorder would have to reopen it, firing `toggle` after `onEnd`. The placeholder and inline styles would also outlive the terminal, while a consumer is most likely to re-render.

**Found by reading, not run:** the prototype's `#startLanding` honors reduced motion only for a behavior that composes `landing()`. A custom behavior's landing ignores it, so the check moves into the lift.

#### DRD-11 — Pull at admission and activation

**`sortable` pulls `items()` at each admission and each activation. `activate` may return `false` to decline quietly.**

The activation pull closes the window between the press and the threshold without a pending flag, since a step before activation now receives `null`. A removed item isn't a fault, so the operation ends with no report. The press cost remains, and `drag:DRO-1` asks the owner to review it with a clean measurement.

#### DRD-12 — The prototype's other results

- **Lint debt:** production passes lint. `then.call` and `composedPath` suppressions need a stated reason.
- **Copied-module vocabulary:** corrected in production under the technical English guide.
- **Example shapes:** the examples stay assumed shapes and become test fixtures. A named Readymag flow is new input and not an open decision.

#### DRD-13 — Completion means correctness, before/after performance and integration

**The handoff's checks are the acceptance. drag2 stays in the tree as reference evidence and is the "before" arm. The deferred integration cleanup is part of completion, and retiring baseline B comes before the new package exports anything. The `prototype/` directory is deleted at completion.**

Earlier cost figures are from other sessions, and two runs of one script differed by about 240 µs on one row, so they can't state a result. Only a same-session comparison with a noise control can. Retirement comes first because a built `@ydinjs/drag` would be measured silently under baseline B's name. Keeping drag2 means the "if drag2 is removed first" exit in `deferred-integration.md` no longer applies.

#### DRD-14 — The lift owns what it writes, until release

**From activation to release the lift owns the visual's inline declarations of every property it writes, and release restores them exactly, including over a write anyone else made during the lift. A commit to one of those properties is made after release, in `end` (built-ins: `onEnd`). A commit the lift does not own may be made in the verdict: DOM order, attributes, classes, custom properties, another element or a model.**

Decides `drag/architecture:challenge-1`. The README's free-drag example commits `translate` in `onDrop`, and release then puts back the value from before the drag, so an accepted drag ends at home in all three engines. `sortable` is unaffected: its commit is DOM order, which the lift doesn't own. `end` runs after release in the decision's task (DRI-9), so a commit there shows no frame at home, which probe `P7c` confirms.

**Rejected: keep a write made during the lift.** A value comparison at release cannot tell a consumer's `top: 0px` from the lift's own `top: 0px`, so a drag to the top edge would lose its commit. Detecting writes as they happen allocates per sample (DRI-17). **Rejected for now: a stylesheet layer** that leaves inline declarations untouched. It would need a sheet in every document and shadow root the visual can live in, which is a redesign of the lift and outside a bounded remediation. It is the route if framework-owned inline styles on a lifted visual become a requirement.

**Cost:** `freeDrag` consumers commit in `onEnd`, and a framework must not write those properties to a lifted visual. The README names the properties.

#### DRD-15 — The landing starts before focus, and focus returns after `end`

**DRI-9's tail becomes: release, then the landing starts, then `end` runs as the next step, and focus is restored when `end` returns or throws, inside that step. An operation without `start` restores right after release. This amends the place `DRD-9` gave the restore, and not its rule.**

Decides `drag/architecture:challenge-5` and `drag/production:reviewer-7`, and gives `reviewer-6`'s missing witness an order to pin.

- **`end` is a hook a behavior may reorder in.** Restoring before it left focus on `body` after a reorder there, in all three engines, so a second arrow press did nothing.
- **The layout:** the recorded trace gives 7 layouts per landed cycle when the landing starts before the focus call, and 7 when a consumer refocuses in `onEnd`, against 8 now. Both before arms read 7. **This is expected, not measured, until the remediation's validation runs.**
- **A destruction applied before the terminal still removes `end` and the restore together (DRI-10).** A destruction requested inside `end` applies after that step, so the restore has run.
- **No `try` is needed around the landing for focus's sake.** The restore no longer follows it in the same block.

#### DRD-16 — Requests through a `Drag` are scoped to its operation

**`drag.requestStep` and `drag.requestCancel` act only while their operation is the controller's current operation. Afterwards both do nothing. The controller's `requestStep` keeps DRI-8 unchanged. A late `use` disposer receives the operation's outcome, and `null` only when destruction released that operation.**

Decides `drag/production:reviewer-1`. The report's choice 4 let a step requested through a retained `Drag` receive a later operation's `Drag`, in three engines. **No tag is needed:** steps drain before the pass that requested them ends, and a new operation opens only as the first step of a new pass, so a step requested while its operation is current can't run under a later one. **`DRD-6`'s stop condition stands:** the list still holds untagged functions.

**Doing nothing was chosen over passing `null`.** A deferred `null` would need a tag per entry. Cleanup after an operation belongs in `use`, which still runs late.

The disposer rule decides the challenge's unprobed hypothesis that a concluded operation's late disposer receives `null` once its controller is destroyed. `Outcome | null` documents `null` as destruction, so any other `null` is a wrong published value.

#### DRD-17 — Input ownership

**The kernel's pointer and `Escape` listening during an operation can't be hidden by a consumer, a press never activates without the button that admitted it, and one event drives at most one operation.**

- **Listening.** The operation's pointer stream and `Escape` are read on the window in the capture phase, so a `stopPropagation` in the page doesn't hide them. The click guard already listens there.
- **Button held.** A pending press reads `buttons` on each sample, and a sample without the admitting button ends the press quietly. A primary press arriving while a press is still pending ends the pending one quietly and is admitted itself. Decides `drag/architecture:challenge-2`. A missed `pointerup` left a press that a hover activated with no button held, and every later press was refused, in all three engines. A release outside the window, with no capture yet, has the same effect, so the `buttons` check is needed even with capture-phase listening.
- **Nested roots.** An event that one controller admitted, by `admit` or `command`, is offered to no other controller. Bubbling reaches the inner root first, so the innermost admitting root wins, and an outer root still admits a press its inner roots declined, such as on a column header. This holds within one copy of the library. Decides `drag/architecture:challenge-3`, where one pointer lifted a card and its column and reordered neither. `data-drag-ignore` is unchanged and is no longer needed for nesting.
- **`Escape`.** An `Escape` that decides an operation that reached `start` has its default prevented, so the platform's close request doesn't also close the dialog or popover that holds the list. The event still propagates. Decides `drag/architecture:challenge-4`. Probe `P3c` shows that preventing the key's default keeps the container open in all three engines. drag2 let the key through, and the contract lists the difference.
- **Native drag is the consumer's.** A natively draggable item or handle, such as a link or an image, needs `draggable="false"`, beside `touch-action` and `user-select`. Decides `drag/architecture:challenge-7`. The library writes no consumer attribute, and preventing `dragstart` would remove a native drag that a consumer might want elsewhere on the same element.
- **The development refusal counter stays scoped** to refusals by a running pass. The new tests witness a missed release directly.
- **Accepted, no change:** a key pressed during a pending keyboard verdict isn't admitted, so its default runs. Activation by time, such as a long press, is not supported. `DRO-3` names where that matters.

#### DRD-18 — Activation

- **The kernel declines quietly for an item disconnected at activation, for every behavior:** no `activate`, `start`, `end` or report. The report's choice 1 is accepted. A lift can't measure a disconnected element, and a behavior without one has nothing to drag. DRI-3 states it.
- **`sortable` pulls `items()` at activation for a command too, and computes the command's target from that pull.** An item missing from that pull, or a move that is no longer possible, declines quietly. Decides `drag/production:reviewer-2`. Foreign code runs between a command's admission and its activation, because the lift opens a popover, and a stale snapshot reported a fault where a pointer declined. One more `items()` call per key press is accepted. The `pointerId !== -1` special case goes with it (`cleanup-3`).
- **A grab during a landing keeps the visual under the pointer.** Activation measures the visual with the flight's current offset, then cancels the flight before the first lifted frame. Decides `drag/architecture:challenge-6`, where the visual sat up to about 80 px from the grab point. The landing is still cancelled by the next activation (DRI-13). A different item's landing is cancelled as before and snaps to its slot, which is not under the pointer.

#### DRD-19 — Free drag measures its offset against home at the drop

**`freeDrag`'s request gives `localDelta*` as the offset from home to the drop position, in the visual's local units. Home is `config.home()`, read once at the drop, or the activation rect when no `home` is given. A home landing uses `home()` at `settle`, as now. `onMove`'s geometry stays pointer travel.**

Decides `drag/architecture:challenge-8`. A scroll during the drag moved the home, and the committed element landed away from the drop by the scroll distance, in all three engines. A rejected landing after such a scroll also starts that far from the drop.

**Rejected: measuring the home inside the library.** The lifted visual has no slot to measure. An ancestor's rect or scroll offset is wrong for a `position: fixed` panel, which a page scroll doesn't move, and for an element whose containing block is outside the scroller. Those are common free-drag subjects. The consumer knows its own scroller. **The limit is documented:** without `home`, the offset is exact only when nothing moved the home during the drag.

#### DRD-20 — The built-ins are internal classes

**Owner requirement, for readability. `sortable()` and `freeDrag()` stay the public factories with unchanged signatures. Each builds one module-private instance, which is the behavior passed to `draggable`, and returns a separate controller object. The single-pass kernel is unchanged.**

**Binding and lifetime:**

- **Hooks need no binding.** The kernel reads each hook from the behavior when it calls it, and calls it as a method of the behavior object. The contract now states this, so it holds for a consumer's class too.
- **Every function passed somewhere that doesn't call it with the instance as `this` has a stable identity.** That covers steps, frame and invalidation callbacks, disposers and controller methods. Each is created once per instance, or once per operation when it closes over the operation, and never per sample, request or call. Coalescing in DRI-8 is by identity, so a step such as `invalidate`'s must be the same function on every request. No `bind` at a call site.
- **Operation values live in the operation's `state`, never in instance fields.** The instance holds controller-lifetime values only: the configuration, the axis and displacement runtimes, the landing timing, the collection version, and scratch buffers rewritten before every read. No instance field holds a `Drag`, an item or an operation's state, so a stale callback can't reach a later operation through the instance.
- **After destruction nothing the library registered references the instance.** The `WeakRef` destruction test covers the instance.
- **Controller methods don't depend on `this`.** This also holds for `draggable`'s own controller. Its `requestCancel`, `requestDestroy` and `use` are prototype methods today and fail when detached, as in `return controller.requestDestroy` from a framework effect. The returned object is not the instance, so `instanceof` and the hook methods stay unreachable.

**Not restored, from the legacy package or drag2:** no base class or inheritance, no superclass shared by the two built-ins, no phase or state machine in a behavior, no registry or emitter, no second request reader, and no `onError`. `Gesture` stays the only class that holds a session.

**CONTRIBUTING §10 holds without amendment:** an instance has the lifecycle identity of one controller. **Its cost is the owner's to read, not accepted here.** The restructure lands as its own behavior-preserving commit, with its size and move cost measured on their own (`DRO-4`).

#### DRD-21 — Internal questions from the discipline pass

- **`LinearShift` and `RectIndex` lose the axis parameters no caller passes** (`cleanup` oq-1). `y()` is the only caller, and no horizontal linear axis is decided. `xy` covers a single row. The parameters come back with such an axis.
- **`sortable/anchor-outside-container` and `sortable/insertion-placeholder-lost` stay** (`cleanup` oq-2). Each guards a state that DRI-15 admits, from a custom-element reaction or a placeholder factory, and so passes CONTRIBUTING §1.1 gate (a). Each needs a test that names its fault.
- **`RectIndex` grows by doubling and no longer shrinks** (`cleanup` oq-3). No measurement ties the shrink policy to a decision. The cache is bounded by the largest list the consumer had and is released with the controller.
- The other `cleanup-*` findings need no decision and are scheduled.

#### DRD-22 — What the 2026-11-06 performance reading established

**The [reading](measurements/2026-11-06-reading.md) and its raw data stand as recorded. Two of its conclusions are withdrawn as acceptance. The rules for the remediation's validation change.**

- **Cycle timing: "no difference" is withdrawn** (`drag/production:reviewer-4`). The verdicts compared the difference of medians with the control's range across rounds, which carries the drift that moves all arms together. Paired within rounds, production's task time is above both before arms in 7 of 7 rounds on 50 cycles at 20 items, by +1,804 µs against drag2 and +1,364 µs against the prototype, which is about 10 to 13 % of a cycle. At 2,000 items it is +3,984 µs against drag2. The A/A pair shows no consistent sign. **Status: unresolved, probably slower.** The reviewer scanned 52 comparisons and could not re-measure on a quiet machine, and the instrument proof never injected into a cycle row. So this is not a measured regression either.
- **Retained heap: the flag stands as the instrument's output** (`drag/production:reviewer-5`). The 0 B floor of an absolute-heap comparison flags any difference in compiled code. The attribution to code and engine tables is plausible, with object and closure totals within 144 B, but its scripts are not in the tree. **Status: decided by manual attribution, not by the instrument.**
- **The landing layout miss** is addressed by `DRD-15` and owes the exact rule.
- **The other rows keep their recorded verdicts until the paired rule re-judges them** from the same raw data. That costs no new run.
- **New rules, fixed before the next run.** Timing is judged by paired differences within rounds against the A/A pair, and a result is reported with its sign count and median whatever the verdict. Retained memory is judged by retained JavaScript objects, separately from code, with the instrument in the tree. The [remediation handoff](remediation-handoff.md) states both, bounds the runs to the affected rows, and requires an injection on a cycle row first.

**No performance tradeoff is accepted here.** A slower row goes to the owner under CONTRIBUTING §0 as `DRO-4`.

#### DRD-23 — Record and instrument policy

- **No findings family for `drag`.** Every finding of the two reviews is closed in this register by a decision or by the remediation handoff, in the commit that reads them, so a register of findings would have no reader. A finding is addressed by its round and local id, such as `drag/production:reviewer-1` or `drag/architecture:challenge-1`. A later round that leaves findings open past its own commit mints `DRF-n` here, under `repo:RD-1`.
- **`entry.sh` resolves `drag`** (`integrity-8`). The scope row is scheduled. CONTRIBUTING's sentence that enumerated the resolved scopes now points to the scope map.
- **A reused path is not a broken citation.** Dated drag2 records that cite a file of the removed package name the commit that holds it. A path the new package has reused resolves to a different file, which the commit disambiguates. No dated record is rewritten.
- **`599684791` must stay reachable** for the prototype arm and `measure.ts --prototype`. A squash merge doesn't keep it, so the `drag/prototype` branch must (`DRO-5`).
- **`bench/lab-drag2.ts` ties `drag`'s typecheck to drag2 source, by design** under `DRD-13`. Removing drag2 removes that arm first.
- **The report's choice 7 is closed.** The owner was told before the legacy output was removed, which the 2026-11-07 request states.

#### DRD-24 — The operation stays a record, and each step that needs it takes it as a parameter

**No class for one operation. `Session` stays a record type that only `Gesture` creates and holds. Every `Gesture` method whose work needs an operation receives the `Session` as a parameter, from the caller that tested for it. `this.#session` is read only where its absence is a case the code handles: the input listeners, the reader, `#runStep`, `#raise`, `#cancel`, admission, the scope checks and teardown. No non-null assertion on `#session` remains.**

Decides the owner's proposal of 2026-11-07, read at `3084191bb`.

**The diagnosis is partly right.** At `3084191bb`, `#move` and `#up` assert `this.#session!` 18 times, 6 of them on an active pointer sample. In those two steps the assertion is the only statement that they need an operation. `#activate`, `#drop`, `#requestVerdict`, `#closeMotion`, `#release` and `#conclude` already take the session as a parameter, so their signatures state the requirement. The 18 assertions came from the code-style pass, not from the class boundary: before it, each of the two steps read the field once into a local.

**Why not a class for one operation.** The record's fields belong to the operation. But every method that would move into such a class also uses controller state:

| Method | Controller state it uses besides the session |
| --- | --- |
| `#move` | `#behavior.move`, `#threshold`, `#window`, then `#activate` |
| `#endPending` | clears `#session` |
| `#activate` | `#behavior`, `#window`, `#root`, `#raise`, and takes and clears `#cancelLanding` |
| `#drop` | `#behavior.drop`, `#root` through `#closeMotion`, and a next step that calls `#requestVerdict` |
| `#requestVerdict` | compares with `#session`, reads `#running`, enters a pass with `#enter`, `#raise` |
| `#release` | `#dispose`, `#raise` |
| `#conclude` | `#behavior`, `#raise`, sets `#cancelLanding`, clears `#session` |
| the `Drag` closures built in `#open` | compare with `#session`, `requestStep`, `#cancel` |

The changing state among these is the current-operation slot, the landing slot and the pass gate, which are `DRD-1`'s mechanism. A class for the operation would reach them in one of three ways, and each costs more than it removes:

- **Members of `Gesture` without `#`.** `draggable()` returns the `Gesture` instance itself, so these members would be reachable from the controller at runtime. The contract forbids that for the session and its slots.
- **Closures injected once per controller.** That is a forwarding interface of about five functions between two classes that share one invariant. CONTRIBUTING §2.2 warns against this layer, and drag2's [single-pass proposal](../../drag2/.plan/reviews/architecture/single-pass-proposal-claude.md) found such layers the main thing to remove.
- **Signals returned to `Gesture`.** The reader would test a new state after each step, which is a phase `DRD-1` doesn't need. Clearing the slot after the step instead of inside it would also let requests made in `end` reach the operation, which changes DRI-8.

**Rejected: moving that controller state into the session.** Each piece exists when no operation exists:

- **The current-operation slot** says whether an operation exists at all. Admission, `#cancel`, `#runStep` and the `Drag` scope checks read it when it may be empty. An operation can't clear the controller's reference to itself without a way back to the controller.
- **The landing** outlives its operation, and the next activation or destruction cancels it (DRI-13). On the session, it would keep the finished session alive until the next press: its `Drag`, item, state and disposers. That breaks idle as absence (`DRD-1`) and `DRD-20`'s retention rule. Handing it to the next session at `#open` still needs a controller slot between the two operations.
- **The pass gate, the step list and the destruction slot** serve passes with no operation: the press that admits one, and `requestStep` or `requestDestroy` on an idle controller. A gate on the session couldn't cover those passes, and two gates would have to agree for DRI-6 to hold.

**Under probe: a state object that `Gesture` and an operation class share, with a read-only view for the operation.** `Gesture` would hold one object in a `#` field, with the slot, the landing and the fixed values, and give each session it creates a `Readonly` view of it. This removes two objections above. Nothing becomes reachable from the controller. The five forwarding closures shrink to shared data plus one function, the pass entry that a verdict settling later needs. A session can call the controller's public `requestStep` and `requestCancel` for its `Drag`. **The read-only view, which the owner proposed, answers the third objection.** Only `Gesture` writes the slot and the landing, and the type checker enforces that. Inside one module the type checker is the guard that matters, because nothing outside the module can reach the object.

**Its cost is that every write the operation makes today moves back to `Gesture`:**

| Write | Today | With a read-only view |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Set the landing | in `#conclude` | `conclude` returns the canceller, and `Gesture` stores it |
| Take the landing | in `#activate`, between the lift's measurement and its first frame | The session can call the canceller but can't clear the field. Either a canceller that has already run stays in the field until `conclude` or teardown replaces it, or `Gesture` hands the landing to the activation |
| Clear the slot, pending press | `#endPending`, from `#move` and `#up` | The sample step tells `Gesture` that the press ended, by a return value: one branch per sample and no allocation |
| Clear the slot, no `start` | in `#conclude`, before focus is restored | `Gesture` clears it, and focus restoration stays in `Gesture`. Otherwise a `drag.requestStep` from a focus listener would run its step with `null` instead of doing nothing (DRI-8) |
| Clear the slot before `end` | in the terminal step | `Gesture` builds the terminal step, so that `end` runs with the slot already clear (DRI-8) |

**The boundary that results:**

- **`Gesture`:** every transition of controller state, which is opening an operation, ending a pending press, concluding with focus and the terminal step, and teardown, together with the gate and the reader.
- **The operation class:** the steps inside one operation, which are the sample and release steps, activation, the drop, the verdict request and release.

The boundary is coherent, and it may read more clearly than one class. Reading alone can't settle two open points: how activation takes the landing, and whether every ordering stays exact once `Gesture` makes the slot writes again. Member names on the class and the object probably survive minification, which nobody has measured.

**Until the probe reports, this decision's parameter form stands.** The composition handoff's kernel item waits for the probe, and its built-in item doesn't.

**The probe.** The coordinator hands it to an implementer, who reports to the architect.

- **Scope:** a temporary worktree from the commit that carries this entry. Only `src/draggable.ts` changes, and nothing is merged. The probe builds this variant with the boundary above.
- **Passes when:**
  - The three-engine suite passes with no test edited, and typecheck and lint pass.
  - No non-null assertion on the slot remains.
  - A sample allocates nothing, and an operation allocates one session.
  - The slot is cleared at the same three points as now, in the same order relative to focus restoration and `end`.
  - `#applyRequests` stays the one reader, and only `Gesture` enters a pass.
- **Records:**
  - The diff as a `.txt` file in `probes/session-class/`.
  - How activation takes the landing, and why.
  - The line counts of `Gesture` and the operation class against `draggable.ts` at the probe's base.
  - The "draggable alone" size row at the probe and at its base, reported as probe evidence and not as a `DRO-4` reading.
  - Every place where the variant needed a check or an ordering that the current code doesn't have.
- **Stops and reports when:** a test needs an edit, an ordering can't be kept, or a sample allocates.
- **Then:** the architect either adopts the variant, amends this decision and rewrites the handoff's kernel item, or keeps the parameter form.

Under CONTRIBUTING §10, the record already gives the operation the identity that the scope checks compare. A class would add methods, not a semantic that the record lacks.

**The implementer's safety explanation is correct. It was checked here, not assumed.** It says that nothing between the reads of `this.#session` in `#onPointer`, `#move` and `#up` can clear the field. At `3084191bb` the field is written only in `#open`, `#endPending`, `#conclude` (at once without `start`, and in the terminal step with it) and `#teardown`. Foreign code reached during a step can't run any of them. `#enter` refuses a nested pass, and `requestDestroy` and every cancel only fill a slot while `#running` is set. Both steps return right after `#endPending`. `#open` runs only from admission, which requires that no session exists. The explanation covered clearing, and the same reasons also exclude replacement. **So no assertion fails today. But each one depends on an invariant of the whole class, which its read site doesn't show and the type checker doesn't check.** The parameter states the same fact where it is used. The commit's other inlinings, in `lift.ts`, `sortable.ts`, `free-drag.ts` and the helpers, read fields that nothing writes between the reads, so they preserve behavior.

**Required properties:**

- A step receives the operation that its listener tested. It allocates nothing per sample (DRI-17), and step identities stay stable.
- The development refusal count still reads the refused event (DRI-6).
- **A local that captures a value before its field is cleared or replaced stays, with its comment.** These are the next step in `#applyRequests`, the lift in `#release` and `#conclude`, the session and the resolver in `#teardown`, and the landing in `#activate`. Removing locals is not a goal. A local that names a value read several times in one step is also allowed.
- The reader's precedence, the gate, the slots and the tests don't change. The change lands as its own behavior-preserving commit.

**`DRD-20` is unchanged.** Its sentence "`Gesture` stays the only class that holds a session" still holds, because no class is added. A second kind of operation, or a way for an operation class to reach controller state without forwarding, would reopen the question.

**No performance or size claim.** At `3084191bb` an active sample reads the field 6 times, and after this decision it reads it once. Nobody measured whether the engine removed the repeated loads.

#### DRD-25 — The built-in factories compose, and pass consumers only documented values

**`sortable()` and `freeDrag()` build the behavior, pass it to `draggable` and return the controller, as `3084191bb` made them do. Each controller-lifetime resource is installed once, in the factory where its disposal is registered. A consumer callback receives its documented values and never the kernel's `Drag`. `items()` is copied at every pull.**

Decides three findings that the implementer reported on the owner's refactor at `3084191bb`.

- **Displacement is installed once.** At `3084191bb` both the constructor and `sortable()` call `config.displacement`. Operations report to the first sink, and destruction retires the second, so row animations outlive the controller. "should cancel a running landing and the row animations" and "should keep a row animation past the terminal, until destruction" fail on it. **`sortable()` calls the installer once, passes the sink to the constructor, and registers its `retire` with the kernel's `use`.** That puts creation and disposal next to each other in the only function that knows both the kernel and the behavior. The constructor keeps installing the axis, because the controller disposes nothing of it. **Rejected: a public `displacement` field that the factory reads.** It would work, but creation and disposal would stay in two places, and that separation is how the defect arose.
- **The `placeholder` factory receives a new object with exactly `item`, `visual`, `box` and `rect`, built once per activation.** At `3084191bb` it receives the operation's `LiftedDrag`, which the type accepts because it has those members too. At runtime the consumer can then call `requestCancel`, `requestStep`, `translate` and `use`, and can read sortable's operation `state`. A factory that keeps its argument also keeps the operation. `freeDrag` already keeps this boundary: `home`, `onStart`, `onMove` and `onDrop` each receive an object of their own. Under CONTRIBUTING §9 the object's reason is that boundary, and it costs one allocation per activation. The contract's public surface now states the rule for every option callback.
- **`items()` is copied at every pull.** The owner withdrew the copy's removal, and `d4286ce64` restores it in `#pull`. CONTRIBUTING §9 names this ownership reason: the snapshot must stay stable when the consumer changes its own array. For example, a consumer updates its model in `onReorder`, and an `Escape` then cancels before the verdict. The landing then reads home from the snapshot. The getter API stays. DRI-14 and the `items` documentation now say that the library copies the array and the consumer keeps ownership. **No test witnessed the copy at `3084191bb`, so its removal passed the suite.** The handoff adds a witness.

**Reconciled with `DRD-20`.** Each factory still builds one module-private instance and returns a separate controller object whose methods don't depend on `this`. The step handed to the kernel, `behavior.invalidate`, is created once per instance. **`moveTo`'s step per call is confirmed**, which answers the remediation report's §Step 2. DRI-8 names it as the case that keeps call order.

## Owner decisions

None blocks the remediation. Each has a default the handoff builds.

#### DRO-1 — Press cost under CONTRIBUTING §0

**Default: pull at admission.** The prototype's press at 2,000 items cost about 440 µs more script than at 20, once per press with no layout, and that figure wasn't separated from the consumer's own `[...root.children]`. **The 2026-11-06 reading separates them:** with a cached array a press costs 53 µs at 2,000 items and 55 µs at 20, so the library's own share doesn't grow. With `[...root.children]` it costs 337 µs. That is +257 µs against drag2, which doesn't pull at a press, with a floor of 223 µs. `DRD-18` adds one pull per keyboard command and none per press. **Recommendation: approve.** The growth is the consumer's `items()`, which a consumer can cache. The alternative is a cached membership check at the press, which adds a cache and a miss path.

#### DRO-2 — A landing can be clipped

**Default: DRD-10.** An item released outside a scrolling list slides back clipped by it, and can pass under a later positioned panel, for the length of the landing. Holding the top layer removes this and brings the costs in DRD-10. **Recommendation: keep the default.** Say so if the clipped flight is unacceptable once you see it, because the change is contained in the lift and `sortable`.

#### DRO-3 — Real devices

**Default: Chromium's emulated touch runs in the suite, and physical touch and pen are stated as unverified.** The implementer has no hardware. **Recommendation: try one touch device and one pen before calling the package released.** The case most likely to differ is `pointercancel` from touch scrolling. **If a touch list that also scrolls can't be dragged there, activation by a long press becomes a feature decision.** The package has no activation by time (`DRD-17`).

#### DRO-4 — Costs measured after remediation

**Default: none is accepted until you read it.** The remediation report gives, under the rules fixed in `DRD-22`:

- the per-cycle time against both before arms, which the 2026-11-06 rounds show as probably 10 to 13 % slower at 20 items;
- the size and move cost of the class restructure alone (`DRD-20`);
- the size of the remediation as a whole, with causes.

A row that is still slower comes with its attributed cause. You decide under CONTRIBUTING §0 whether to accept it or have it removed. **No recommendation until the figures exist.**

**After `3084191bb`:** the remediation report's readings measured `b91db2818`. `3084191bb` and the composition handoff change the kernel and both built-ins, so those readings describe only `b91db2818`. A size figure the implementer saw on the uncommitted tree after `3084191bb` is not recorded, and isn't a reading. A figure offered for this decision names the commit it measured.

#### DRO-5 — Keep `599684791` reachable after the squash merge

**The repository allows only squash merges, so `main` won't contain `599684791`.** Once `drag/production` is squashed and its branch deleted, the commit stays reachable only through another ref. On 2026-11-07 that ref is `origin/drag/prototype`, whose tip `a1d31e0d2` descends from `599684791`. `origin/drag/production` holds it too, but merging normally deletes that branch. The `compare` instrument's prototype arm and `measure.ts --prototype` read the commit with `git archive`, and fail without it.

**Default: keep `drag/prototype` as the ref that preserves it.** No tag and no settings change is needed.

- **Before merge:** `git branch -r --contains 599684791` must list `origin/drag/prototype`.
- **While either instrument names the commit:** don't delete, rewrite or force-push `drag/prototype`.
- **On a checkout of `main` alone,** which includes a single-branch clone: run `git fetch origin drag/prototype` before either instrument.

**The alternative is to retire the prototype arm** from both instruments before merge, after the remediation's validation has read it. The branch then stops mattering, and the 2026-11-06 and remediation readings keep the arm's figures. **Recommendation: keep the branch until the owner has read `DRO-4`, then decide whether to retire the arm.**
