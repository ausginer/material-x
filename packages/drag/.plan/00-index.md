# `@ydinjs/drag` record: decisions

The register for scope `drag`, under `repo:RD-1`: decisions are `DRD-n`, invariants `DRI-n`, owner decisions `DRO-n`. Numbering starts at 1. drag2's bare `D-` series is separate. To read one entry:

```sh
awk -v re="^#### DRD-1( —|$)" \
  '$0 ~ re {f=1;print;next} f && /^#{1,4} /{exit} f' \
  packages/drag/.plan/00-index.md
```

**Input:** the prototype read at `26f82fbb1`. That commit is on no ref now. Its `packages/drag` tree is byte-identical to `599684791` on `drag/prototype`, so later citations use `599684791`. Evidence: [`prototype-report.md`](prototype-report.md), [`probes/prototype/`](probes/prototype/README.md), [`probes/final-design/`](probes/final-design/README.md). The comparison and earlier evidence are in [`architecture-plan.md`](architecture-plan.md).

**Status, 2026-11-07:** production was built at `d7e7b0d3a` on `drag/production` and reviewed twice at that commit: a [review round](reviews/production/production-summary.md) and an [architecture challenge](reviews/architecture/production-design-challenge.md). `DRD-14` to `DRD-23` decide every finding and question from both. Where they change an earlier decision, its status row names the amendment. The required behavior is in [`contract.md`](contract.md). The [remediation](remediation-report.md) implemented them at `b91db2818`, and no independent review has read it yet. The owner's composition refactor at `3084191bb` and the implementer's findings on it are decided by `DRD-24` and `DRD-25`. `DRD-24` was revised to the owner's ownership model, and [`session-prototype-handoff.md`](session-prototype-handoff.md) tests it before production adopts it. [`composition-handoff.md`](composition-handoff.md)'s built-in item can start, and its kernel item waits for that prototype.

**Neither the prototype's approval nor the 2026-11-06 reading established a performance result.** `DRD-13` and `DRD-22` say what does.

## Decisions

#### DRD-1 — Single-pass control

**One `Session` record, with idle as its absence. `#running` refuses a nested pass, and one reader applies requests between steps, with precedence destroy, deferred steps, decision, next step.**

Foreign code runs synchronously inside DOM writes, and the independent model's commit order failed there (architecture plan §3). The prototype held this through the public API in three engines, in 10 scenarios. One decision slot replaces three because the first of cancel, fault and verdict always wins. FIFO between kinds of request is rejected. The two booleans `concluded` and `released` are accepted: nothing reads them as a phase, and the implementer may remove them.

#### DRD-2 — One public authoring API

**`draggable` is public, and `sortable` and `freeDrag` use only its public values and types. A behavior never receives the session. Extension is by whole behavior. No third-party `axis` or plugin seam is published.**

Owner requirement, with possible Readymag use. The prototype showed no private kernel path was needed, and `Drag` has no reference to the session. Its additions are accepted: `command`, `handle` with `data-drag-ignore`, `settle` returning timing, `panel.use`, and `onEnd` carrying `request`. An axis seam stays out because no example wanted one, and adding it later breaks nothing. `createFrameTask`, `listenForInvalidation` and the landing policy stay private (CONTRIBUTING §4), because a behavior can write each in a few lines. A kernel frame hook is rejected for the same reason: every composition would pay for it.

#### DRD-3 — Faults through `reportError`

**`onError` is removed. Every report is one `DragFault`, sent through the library realm's `reportError` when caught, with `cause` by identity. The decision slot is filled before the report.**

Owner requirement. Eight hostile values and both listener cases passed in three engines. The fault's message keeps the original's text, because `event.message` omits `cause`. How each engine's DevTools prints `cause` is still unobserved, and that can change only the message wording. No step or root field is added.

#### DRD-4 — The lift is an imported value

**`lift` replaces `lift: false`. With no `lift` key, the bundle has no `presentation` or `box-quad` code from the kernel. `startLanding` and the lift's view fields belong to the lift module, and their types appear only when `lift` is composed.**

`presentation` and `box-quad` are 4,389 of `draggable`'s 10,119 minified bytes, and a no-lift behavior never runs them (report §Size). A boolean can't be shaken, so the prototype's design violates CONTRIBUTING §7. A value also fixes the report's type defect, where `rect` was non-null but unset. **Cost:** one more export and one more import for a lifted custom behavior. `draggable` alone should fall to about 5.7 KB minified, **estimated**.

#### DRD-5 — `box-quad` is the one coordinate model

**Behaviors with and without the lift use `Space`, `Box` and a new `localDelta` from `@ydinjs/box-quad`. `InheritedSpace` and the canvas example's size ratio are removed. A no-lift behavior imports `box-quad` itself and pays only for what it uses. Recorded in that package as `box-quad:BQ-10`.**

Owner requirement. Both linear parts sit in the same four slots, so one pure function serves both. A throwaway function with this signature gave zero error across rotate, scale, skew, zoom, own rotate and resize, in three engines ([results](probes/final-design/results.json.txt)). The one miss was the element's own `zoom`, which a `Space` excludes by definition, and DRI-16 states it. The kernel does not read a basis for a no-lift behavior: which element and which basis are the behavior's knowledge, and a resize handle in an untransformed page should not pay for an ancestor walk.

#### DRD-6 — `requestStep` replaces `run`, `requestApply` and `apply`

**One request runs behavior code in a pass: at once when idle of a pass, between steps otherwise. The step receives the `Drag` only while the operation is active and undecided, and `null` otherwise. Hooks also get `drag.requestStep` and `drag.requestCancel`.**

This resolves four difficulties in the report. `run` was refused silently inside a pass. `requestApply` needed a holding variable outside the drag. Both built-ins wrote the same `released` flag. Hooks named a controller declared after them, the source of the 8 `no-use-before-define` errors. It also fixes the `moveTo` defect, where a write behind a cancel moved the visual and the landing's start.

**This is a short list, and it does not bring back the queue.** It holds only steps, on one precedence level, and is empty on the hot path. Destruction and the decision remain slots, nothing is tagged or reordered, and no pointer sample enters it. **I withdraw the plan's "the kernel grows a queue" stop condition for this one list.** The condition's concern, a second reader or FIFO across kinds, still holds as a stop condition. Identity coalescing keeps change 5, where two `invalidate()` calls pull once. A cancel followed by `invalidate()` no longer pulls first, which removes the report's one visible FIFO difference.

The rule that an author must not write directly from foreign code stays a documented rule. Nothing can detect a violation.

#### DRD-7 — A disposer receives the outcome

**`drag.use` disposers receive the `Outcome`, or `null` on destruction. A late `use`, on an operation or a controller, runs at once.**

Rollback had to live in `use` because `end` doesn't run on destruction, and `use` couldn't see the outcome, so the canvas example needed a flag set in `settle`. With the argument, one disposer states the rollback. **This answers open question 5: destruction with no `end` stays,** and the cost it showed is removed.

#### DRD-8 — The click guard outlives destruction

**DRI-11 wins over "all listeners are gone" in DRI-10. The guard stays until it expires, holds no reference to the item or controller, and also expires at the next primary press.**

The defect ran: destroying with the button held delivered the trailing click in all three engines ([results](probes/final-design/results.json.txt)). A stray click is a user-visible effect, and a guard bounded by one gesture runs no consumer code. The new press expiry keeps "no later click is swallowed" when a release never reaches the window. It costs one more listener in the guard.

#### DRD-9 — The kernel keeps focus through an operation

**DRI-12. Implemented in the kernel and the lift, so every behavior gets it with no code. Not on destruction. It never takes focus from an element focused since the drop.**

The probe showed focus goes to `body` after keyboard and pointer reorders in all three engines, and `insertBefore`, which the API encourages, causes it. A second arrow press then does nothing, so keyboard reordering fails unless a consumer repairs it. The lift also moved focus to an `autofocus` descendant in all three engines. **This narrows the "no focus management" boundary in `accessibility.md`** for the new package: the consumer still owns `tabindex`, roles and announcements. Restoring in the consumer would leave a defect in the documented example.

#### DRD-10 — Landing elevation by animation

**The flight animates `z-index` and, for a static item, `position`, in a separate replacing animation. Presentation is still released before the landing and terminal. Reduced motion moves into the lift, so it covers every behavior.**

Results, in three engines: with elevation the item stayed on top of `relative` and `z-index: 5` siblings, and left no inline style. **One additive animation is rejected:** in WebKit, adding to the item's own `z-index: 5` wrapped it to `-2147483648` and the item went under.

**Holding the top layer for the flight is rejected, and `drag:DRO-2` keeps it open as the alternative.** It would fix clipping as well. But a consumer's `insertBefore` already closes the popover in all three engines, so an accepted reorder would have to reopen it, firing `toggle` after `onEnd`. The placeholder and inline styles would also outlive the terminal, while a consumer is most likely to re-render.

**Found by reading, not run:** the prototype's `#startLanding` honors reduced motion only for a behavior that composes `landing()`. A custom behavior's landing ignores it, so the check moves into the lift.

#### DRD-11 — Pull at admission and activation

**`sortable` pulls `items()` at each admission and each activation. `activate` may return `false` to decline quietly.**

The activation pull closes the window between the press and the threshold without a pending flag, since a step before activation now receives `null`. A removed item isn't a fault, so the operation ends with no report. The press cost remains, and `drag:DRO-1` asks the owner to review it with a clean measurement.

#### DRD-12 — The prototype's other results

- **Lint debt:** production passes lint. `then.call` and `composedPath` suppressions need a stated reason.
- **Copied-module vocabulary:** corrected in production under the technical English guide.
- **Example shapes:** the examples stay assumed shapes and become test fixtures. A named Readymag flow is new input and not an open decision.

#### DRD-13 — Completion means correctness, before/after performance and integration

**The handoff's checks are the acceptance. drag2 stays in the tree as reference evidence and is the "before" arm. The deferred integration cleanup is part of completion, and retiring baseline B comes before the new package exports anything. The `prototype/` directory is deleted at completion.**

Earlier cost figures are from other sessions, and two runs of one script differed by about 240 µs on one row, so they can't state a result. Only a same-session comparison with a noise control can. Retirement comes first because a built `@ydinjs/drag` would be measured silently under baseline B's name. Keeping drag2 means the "if drag2 is removed first" exit in `deferred-integration.md` no longer applies.

#### DRD-14 — The lift owns what it writes, until release

**From activation to release the lift owns the visual's inline declarations of every property it writes, and release restores them exactly, including over a write anyone else made during the lift. A commit to one of those properties is made after release, in `end` (built-ins: `onEnd`). A commit the lift does not own may be made in the verdict: DOM order, attributes, classes, custom properties, another element or a model.**

Decides `drag/architecture:challenge-1`. The README's free-drag example commits `translate` in `onDrop`, and release then puts back the value from before the drag, so an accepted drag ends at home in all three engines. `sortable` is unaffected: its commit is DOM order, which the lift doesn't own. `end` runs after release in the decision's task (DRI-9), so a commit there shows no frame at home, which probe `P7c` confirms.

**Rejected: keep a write made during the lift.** A value comparison at release cannot tell a consumer's `top: 0px` from the lift's own `top: 0px`, so a drag to the top edge would lose its commit. Detecting writes as they happen allocates per sample (DRI-17). **Rejected for now: a stylesheet layer** that leaves inline declarations untouched. It would need a sheet in every document and shadow root the visual can live in, which is a redesign of the lift and outside a bounded remediation. It is the route if framework-owned inline styles on a lifted visual become a requirement.

**Cost:** `freeDrag` consumers commit in `onEnd`, and a framework must not write those properties to a lifted visual. The README names the properties.

#### DRD-15 — The landing starts before focus, and focus returns after `end`

**DRI-9's tail becomes: release, then the landing starts, then `end` runs as the next step, and focus is restored when `end` returns or throws, inside that step. An operation without `start` restores right after release. This amends the place `DRD-9` gave the restore, and not its rule.**

Decides `drag/architecture:challenge-5` and `drag/production:reviewer-7`, and gives `reviewer-6`'s missing witness an order to pin.

- **`end` is a hook a behavior may reorder in.** Restoring before it left focus on `body` after a reorder there, in all three engines, so a second arrow press did nothing.
- **The layout:** the recorded trace gives 7 layouts per landed cycle when the landing starts before the focus call, and 7 when a consumer refocuses in `onEnd`, against 8 now. Both before arms read 7. **This is expected, not measured, until the remediation's validation runs.**
- **A destruction applied before the terminal still removes `end` and the restore together (DRI-10).** A destruction requested inside `end` applies after that step, so the restore has run.
- **No `try` is needed around the landing for focus's sake.** The restore no longer follows it in the same block.

#### DRD-16 — Requests through a `Drag` are scoped to its operation

**`drag.requestStep` and `drag.requestCancel` act only while their operation is the controller's current operation. Afterwards both do nothing. The controller's `requestStep` keeps DRI-8 unchanged. A late `use` disposer receives the operation's outcome, and `null` only when destruction released that operation.**

Decides `drag/production:reviewer-1`. The report's choice 4 let a step requested through a retained `Drag` receive a later operation's `Drag`, in three engines. **No tag is needed:** steps drain before the pass that requested them ends, and a new operation opens only as the first step of a new pass, so a step requested while its operation is current can't run under a later one. **`DRD-6`'s stop condition stands:** the list still holds untagged functions.

**Doing nothing was chosen over passing `null`.** A deferred `null` would need a tag per entry. Cleanup after an operation belongs in `use`, which still runs late.

The disposer rule decides the challenge's unprobed hypothesis that a concluded operation's late disposer receives `null` once its controller is destroyed. `Outcome | null` documents `null` as destruction, so any other `null` is a wrong published value.

#### DRD-17 — Input ownership

**The kernel's pointer and `Escape` listening during an operation can't be hidden by a consumer, a press never activates without the button that admitted it, and one event drives at most one operation.**

- **Listening.** The operation's pointer stream and `Escape` are read on the window in the capture phase, so a `stopPropagation` in the page doesn't hide them. The click guard already listens there.
- **Button held.** A pending press reads `buttons` on each sample, and a sample without the admitting button ends the press quietly. A primary press arriving while a press is still pending ends the pending one quietly and is admitted itself. Decides `drag/architecture:challenge-2`. A missed `pointerup` left a press that a hover activated with no button held, and every later press was refused, in all three engines. A release outside the window, with no capture yet, has the same effect, so the `buttons` check is needed even with capture-phase listening.
- **Nested roots.** An event that one controller admitted, by `admit` or `command`, is offered to no other controller. Bubbling reaches the inner root first, so the innermost admitting root wins, and an outer root still admits a press its inner roots declined, such as on a column header. This holds within one copy of the library. Decides `drag/architecture:challenge-3`, where one pointer lifted a card and its column and reordered neither. `data-drag-ignore` is unchanged and is no longer needed for nesting.
- **`Escape`.** An `Escape` that decides an operation that reached `start` has its default prevented, so the platform's close request doesn't also close the dialog or popover that holds the list. The event still propagates. Decides `drag/architecture:challenge-4`. Probe `P3c` shows that preventing the key's default keeps the container open in all three engines. drag2 let the key through, and the contract lists the difference.
- **Native drag is the consumer's.** A natively draggable item or handle, such as a link or an image, needs `draggable="false"`, beside `touch-action` and `user-select`. Decides `drag/architecture:challenge-7`. The library writes no consumer attribute, and preventing `dragstart` would remove a native drag that a consumer might want elsewhere on the same element.
- **The development refusal counter stays scoped** to refusals by a running pass. The new tests witness a missed release directly.
- **Accepted, no change:** a key pressed during a pending keyboard verdict isn't admitted, so its default runs. Activation by time, such as a long press, is not supported. `DRO-3` names where that matters.

#### DRD-18 — Activation

- **The kernel declines quietly for an item disconnected at activation, for every behavior:** no `activate`, `start`, `end` or report. The report's choice 1 is accepted. A lift can't measure a disconnected element, and a behavior without one has nothing to drag. DRI-3 states it.
- **`sortable` pulls `items()` at activation for a command too, and computes the command's target from that pull.** An item missing from that pull, or a move that is no longer possible, declines quietly. Decides `drag/production:reviewer-2`. Foreign code runs between a command's admission and its activation, because the lift opens a popover, and a stale snapshot reported a fault where a pointer declined. One more `items()` call per key press is accepted. The `pointerId !== -1` special case goes with it (`cleanup-3`).
- **A grab during a landing keeps the visual under the pointer.** Activation measures the visual with the flight's current offset, then cancels the flight before the first lifted frame. Decides `drag/architecture:challenge-6`, where the visual sat up to about 80 px from the grab point. The landing is still cancelled by the next activation (DRI-13). A different item's landing is cancelled as before and snaps to its slot, which is not under the pointer.

#### DRD-19 — Free drag measures its offset against home at the drop

**`freeDrag`'s request gives `localDelta*` as the offset from home to the drop position, in the visual's local units. Home is `config.home()`, read once at the drop, or the activation rect when no `home` is given. A home landing uses `home()` at `settle`, as now. `onMove`'s geometry stays pointer travel.**

Decides `drag/architecture:challenge-8`. A scroll during the drag moved the home, and the committed element landed away from the drop by the scroll distance, in all three engines. A rejected landing after such a scroll also starts that far from the drop.

**Rejected: measuring the home inside the library.** The lifted visual has no slot to measure. An ancestor's rect or scroll offset is wrong for a `position: fixed` panel, which a page scroll doesn't move, and for an element whose containing block is outside the scroller. Those are common free-drag subjects. The consumer knows its own scroller. **The limit is documented:** without `home`, the offset is exact only when nothing moved the home during the drag.

#### DRD-20 — The built-ins are internal classes

**Owner requirement, for readability. `sortable()` and `freeDrag()` stay the public factories with unchanged signatures. Each builds one module-private instance, which is the behavior passed to `draggable`, and returns a separate controller object. The single-pass kernel is unchanged.**

**Binding and lifetime:**

- **Hooks need no binding.** The kernel reads each hook from the behavior when it calls it, and calls it as a method of the behavior object. The contract now states this, so it holds for a consumer's class too.
- **Every function passed somewhere that doesn't call it with the instance as `this` has a stable identity.** That covers steps, frame and invalidation callbacks, disposers and controller methods. Each is created once per instance, or once per operation when it closes over the operation, and never per sample, request or call. Coalescing in DRI-8 is by identity, so a step such as `invalidate`'s must be the same function on every request. No `bind` at a call site.
- **Operation values live in the operation's `state`, never in instance fields.** The instance holds controller-lifetime values only: the configuration, the axis and displacement runtimes, the landing timing, the collection version, and scratch buffers rewritten before every read. No instance field holds a `Drag`, an item or an operation's state, so a stale callback can't reach a later operation through the instance.
- **After destruction nothing the library registered references the instance.** The `WeakRef` destruction test covers the instance.
- **Controller methods don't depend on `this`.** This also holds for `draggable`'s own controller. Its `requestCancel`, `requestDestroy` and `use` are prototype methods today and fail when detached, as in `return controller.requestDestroy` from a framework effect. The returned object is not the instance, so `instanceof` and the hook methods stay unreachable.

**Not restored, from the legacy package or drag2:** no base class or inheritance, no superclass shared by the two built-ins, no phase or state machine in a behavior, no registry or emitter, no second request reader, and no `onError`. `Gesture` stays the only class that holds a session.

**CONTRIBUTING §10 holds without amendment:** an instance has the lifecycle identity of one controller. **Its cost is the owner's to read, not accepted here.** The restructure lands as its own behavior-preserving commit, with its size and move cost measured on their own (`DRO-4`).

#### DRD-21 — Internal questions from the discipline pass

- **`LinearShift` and `RectIndex` lose the axis parameters no caller passes** (`cleanup` oq-1). `y()` is the only caller, and no horizontal linear axis is decided. `xy` covers a single row. The parameters come back with such an axis.
- **`sortable/anchor-outside-container` and `sortable/insertion-placeholder-lost` stay** (`cleanup` oq-2). Each guards a state that DRI-15 admits, from a custom-element reaction or a placeholder factory, and so passes CONTRIBUTING §1.1 gate (a). Each needs a test that names its fault.
- **`RectIndex` grows by doubling and no longer shrinks** (`cleanup` oq-3). No measurement ties the shrink policy to a decision. The cache is bounded by the largest list the consumer had and is released with the controller.
- The other `cleanup-*` findings need no decision and are scheduled.

#### DRD-22 — What the 2026-11-06 performance reading established

**The [reading](measurements/2026-11-06-reading.md) and its raw data stand as recorded. Two of its conclusions are withdrawn as acceptance. The rules for the remediation's validation change.**

- **Cycle timing: "no difference" is withdrawn** (`drag/production:reviewer-4`). The verdicts compared the difference of medians with the control's range across rounds, which carries the drift that moves all arms together. Paired within rounds, production's task time is above both before arms in 7 of 7 rounds on 50 cycles at 20 items, by +1,804 µs against drag2 and +1,364 µs against the prototype, which is about 10 to 13 % of a cycle. At 2,000 items it is +3,984 µs against drag2. The A/A pair shows no consistent sign. **Status: unresolved, probably slower.** The reviewer scanned 52 comparisons and could not re-measure on a quiet machine, and the instrument proof never injected into a cycle row. So this is not a measured regression either.
- **Retained heap: the flag stands as the instrument's output** (`drag/production:reviewer-5`). The 0 B floor of an absolute-heap comparison flags any difference in compiled code. The attribution to code and engine tables is plausible, with object and closure totals within 144 B, but its scripts are not in the tree. **Status: decided by manual attribution, not by the instrument.**
- **The landing layout miss** is addressed by `DRD-15` and owes the exact rule.
- **The other rows keep their recorded verdicts until the paired rule re-judges them** from the same raw data. That costs no new run.
- **New rules, fixed before the next run.** Timing is judged by paired differences within rounds against the A/A pair, and a result is reported with its sign count and median whatever the verdict. Retained memory is judged by retained JavaScript objects, separately from code, with the instrument in the tree. The [remediation handoff](remediation-handoff.md) states both, bounds the runs to the affected rows, and requires an injection on a cycle row first.

**No performance tradeoff is accepted here.** A slower row goes to the owner under CONTRIBUTING §0 as `DRO-4`.

#### DRD-23 — Record and instrument policy

- **No findings family for `drag`.** Every finding of the two reviews is closed in this register by a decision or by the remediation handoff, in the commit that reads them, so a register of findings would have no reader. A finding is addressed by its round and local id, such as `drag/production:reviewer-1` or `drag/architecture:challenge-1`. A later round that leaves findings open past its own commit mints `DRF-n` here, under `repo:RD-1`.
- **`entry.sh` resolves `drag`** (`integrity-8`). The scope row is scheduled. CONTRIBUTING's sentence that enumerated the resolved scopes now points to the scope map.
- **A reused path is not a broken citation.** Dated drag2 records that cite a file of the removed package name the commit that holds it. A path the new package has reused resolves to a different file, which the commit disambiguates. No dated record is rewritten.
- **`599684791` must stay reachable** for the prototype arm and `measure.ts --prototype`. A squash merge doesn't keep it, so the `drag/prototype` branch must (`DRO-5`).
- **`bench/lab-drag2.ts` ties `drag`'s typecheck to drag2 source, by design** under `DRD-13`. Removing drag2 removes that arm first.
- **The report's choice 7 is closed.** The owner was told before the legacy output was removed, which the 2026-11-07 request states.

#### DRD-24 — An operation owns its state and transitions, and the controller owns what spans operations

**Owner requirement, 2026-11-07. The controller owns its lifetime across operations. A session owns one operation and performs it. The two talk through a small interface, and neither reads or writes the other's fields. This is the target model. A prototype tests it before production adopts it: [`session-prototype-handoff.md`](session-prototype-handoff.md). Until the architect adopts it, production keeps the structure of `3084191bb`, and the fallback below stays decided.**

Revised after reading `fbe2839c3` and the probe's candidate, which the owner applied on `drag/session-class-preview`. The earlier text decided a record passed to each step as a parameter (`6f8ea3d91`), and then defined the probe of a shared state with a read-only view (`184f430bb`). Those commits hold the superseded text.

**The boundary:**

- **The controller, `Gesture`,** holds what exists across operations or with no operation. That is the root, the behavior, the window and the threshold, the root's listeners, controller disposers, admission, the gate, the step list, the destruction slot, the reader, the current-operation slot and the landing. It creates a session, attaches it to the slot, clears the slot when the session asks, and tears down.
- **The session** holds one operation and makes all of its transitions. It holds the operation's `Drag` and admission, the motion and operation signals with the listeners on them, disposers, phase, decision, next step, verdict, lift, focus and release outcome. Its transitions are samples and the threshold, ending a pending press, activation, the drop, the verdict, conclusion, the terminal step, and release when destruction ends it.
- **Each side calls the other's interface below.** Everything else in each class is `#`-private.

**The interface.** This is the smallest set found by reading the kernel at `fbe2839c3`. The prototype confirms it or reports what it needed beyond it.

From the controller to the session:

| Member | What it does | What it replaces at `fbe2839c3` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Construction | Opens the operation: builds its `Drag` and installs its listeners. A command operation sets its own first step, the activation | `#open`, and `#command`'s write to `next` |
| Advance | One turn of the reader for the operation. It concludes a decision that isn't applied yet, or else takes and runs the next step. It reports whether it did either | The reader's decision and next-step branches |
| Decide | Records an outcome if none is recorded. It enters no pass | `decision ??=` in `#raise` and `#cancel` |
| Step target | The `Drag` that a deferred step receives: the operation's from activation until the drop or the decision, and `null` otherwise | `#runStep`'s condition |
| Terminate | Destruction's part. It closes motion, aborts the verdict and releases with `null` | The session branch of `#teardown` |

From the session to the controller:

| Member | What it does | What it replaces at `fbe2839c3` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The gate | Enters a pass with a stable step and its argument, or refuses | `#enter`, unchanged. It stays the only entry |
| Raise | Reports a fault, and decides the current operation if nothing has | `#raise`, unchanged. The lift receives it as now |
| Is current | Whether this session is the one in the slot | `this.#session === session` in the `Drag`'s scope checks and in the verdict's completion |
| Detach | Clears the slot. The session calls it at the three points where the base clears it | The three writes of `null` to `#session` outside teardown |
| Take and keep the landing | At activation, takes and clears the landing before the lift measures. At conclusion, stores the new one | `#activate`'s and `#conclude`'s writes to `#cancelLanding` |
| The verdict's way in | Lets a verdict that settles inside a pass be applied by that pass, and one that settles outside enter a new pass. The prototype chooses its form | `complete`'s read of `#running` |
| `requestStep` | The controller's public method, which a `Drag` forwards to | Unchanged |
| The fixed values | The behavior, root, window and threshold | Read only |

**The slot and the landing stay the controller's.** Only controller code writes them, and the session decides when. In the probe, the controller also decided when, and that is the difference.

**What the probe at `fbe2839c3` showed.** The [probe](probes/session-class/README.md) is evidence about the boundary it was told to build. It is not evidence against an operation class. It kept every ordering, and its Chromium results equal the base's. It missed the owner's goal because this entry's earlier text set four restrictions:

| Restriction | What it produced | Now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Only `Gesture` writes the slot and the landing, so only `Gesture` makes a transition that writes them | A split lifecycle. Ending a pending press, activation, conclusion with focus, the terminal step and the verdict's completion stayed in `Gesture`. Result codes from the sample step told `Gesture` which of them to run | **Withdrawn.** The controller still owns and writes them. The session calls it, inside the step that makes the transition. No step returns a code |
| Only `Gesture` enters a pass | `complete` on the shared record | **Narrowed to one gate.** The gate is the controller's `#enter`, and the session's listeners and its verdict call it. The property is one gate, not one caller |
| An interface between the two classes is the forwarding layer that CONTRIBUTING §2.2 warns against | A shared record in place of calls | **Withdrawn.** §2.2 is about generic mechanisms built to remove duplication. A fixed interface between two lifetimes is the static construction-time topology that §2.2 prefers, and each member names a controller responsibility |
| `draggable()` returns the `Gesture` instance, so a member without `#` is reachable from the controller | The interface had to be a record that the consumer can't reach | **Changed.** `draggable()` returns a separate object with exactly `requestStep`, `requestCancel`, `requestDestroy` and `use`, as `DRD-20` already requires of the built-ins. The controller's interface is then reachable only inside the module |

**Also withdrawn: the claim that under CONTRIBUTING §10 a class "would add methods, not a semantic".** An operation has a meaningful lifecycle identity, which the scope checks compare. Under the owner's boundary the class carries that identity and encapsulates the operation's state. A record whose fields `Gesture` reads does neither.

**Still rejected: moving controller state into the session.** The slot, the landing, the gate, the step list and the destruction slot exist when no operation does:

- **The slot** says whether an operation exists. Admission, `#cancel`, `#runStep` and the scope checks read it when it may be empty.
- **The landing** outlives its operation, and the next activation or destruction cancels it (DRI-13). On the session it would keep the finished operation alive until the next press, which breaks idle as absence (`DRD-1`) and `DRD-20`'s retention rule.
- **The gate, the step list and the destruction slot** also serve passes with no operation: the press that admits one, and `requestStep` or `requestDestroy` on an idle controller.

**Rejected ways for the session to reach the controller:**

- **A class nested in `Gesture`'s body,** which could use `Gesture`'s `#` names. The names would stay mangled, but the two lifetimes would read as one class again.
- **A record of closures created once per controller.** It has the same members and adds one closure for each. It gains nothing over methods once `draggable()` returns a separate object.
- **A shared state with a read-only view,** which is the probe's form. `Readonly` is shallow, and the controller still reads the session's fields.

**Required properties:**

- **One gate and one reader.** The reader's precedence stays destruction, deferred steps, the operation's decision, then its next step. The decision and the next step are applied only during the reader's turn.
- **Requests only fill slots, and only the reader applies them** (`DRD-1`).
- **The slot is cleared at the same three points as at `fbe2839c3`, in the same order.** A pending press clears it after both aborts. Without `start`, it is cleared before focus is restored. With `start`, it is cleared before `end` (DRI-8). Teardown keeps its order.
- **The landing is taken before the lift measures, and cancelled after it.** It is stored at conclusion, so a destruction applied later in the same pass cancels it (DRI-13).
- **Nothing is allocated per sample** (DRI-17). A step passed to the gate is a stable function. The development refusal count still reads the refused event (DRI-6).
- **Neither the controller object, a `Drag` nor any hook argument reaches the session or the controller's interface.**
- **A local that captures a value before its field is cleared or replaced stays, with its comment.** Removing locals is not a goal, and `using` is not introduced.
- **The tests and the public types don't change.** Adoption lands as its own behavior-preserving commit.

**Fallback.** If the prototype fails a required property that no change to the interface can fix, `Session` stays a record. `#move` and `#up` then receive the session that `#onPointer` tested, and no `this.#session!` remains. [`composition-handoff.md`](composition-handoff.md) item 1 states this form and stays on hold.

**The implementer's safety explanation was checked and is correct.** At `3084191bb`, nothing between the reads of `this.#session` in `#onPointer`, `#move` and `#up` can clear or replace the field, so no assertion fails. But each assertion depends on an invariant of the whole class, which its read site doesn't show. Both forms remove the assertions. In the class form, the session's methods have the operation as `this`. The commit's other inlinings, in `lift.ts`, `sortable.ts`, `free-drag.ts` and the helpers, read fields that nothing writes between the reads, so they preserve behavior.

**Reconciled:**

- **`DRD-1`:** one session object, with idle as its absence. A class instance is that object, and the gate and the reader stay in the controller.
- **`DRD-16`:** the scope check still compares with the slot. The session asks the controller.
- **`DRD-20`:** its sentence "`Gesture` stays the only class that holds a session" becomes: `Gesture` is the only class that holds the current session, and the session class is the operation. `DRD-20` said that a way for an operation class to reach controller state without forwarding would reopen the question. The owner's requirement reopened it, and the interface above answers it. `DRD-20`'s other rules apply to the session class: stable identities for every function passed out, no `bind` at a call site, and nothing retained after destruction.
- **The contract doesn't change.** The members of `DraggableController` stay. The contract already forbids a behavior to reach the session, and no entry says the controller is the `Gesture` instance.

**Not decided: size and performance.** The interface's member names are not mangled. The probe attributed 424 B of its 770 B minified growth to such names, on a different interface. The prototype reports its figures as evidence. At adoption, a cost goes to the owner under CONTRIBUTING §0 and §14 and `DRO-4`'s rules.

#### DRD-25 — The built-in factories compose, and pass consumers only documented values

**`sortable()` and `freeDrag()` build the behavior, pass it to `draggable` and return the controller, as `3084191bb` made them do. Each controller-lifetime resource is installed once, in the factory where its disposal is registered. A consumer callback receives its documented values and never the kernel's `Drag`. `items()` is copied at every pull.**

Decides three findings that the implementer reported on the owner's refactor at `3084191bb`.

- **Displacement is installed once.** At `3084191bb` both the constructor and `sortable()` call `config.displacement`. Operations report to the first sink, and destruction retires the second, so row animations outlive the controller. "should cancel a running landing and the row animations" and "should keep a row animation past the terminal, until destruction" fail on it. **`sortable()` calls the installer once, passes the sink to the constructor, and registers its `retire` with the kernel's `use`.** That puts creation and disposal next to each other in the only function that knows both the kernel and the behavior. The constructor keeps installing the axis, because the controller disposes nothing of it. **Rejected: a public `displacement` field that the factory reads.** It would work, but creation and disposal would stay in two places, and that separation is how the defect arose.
- **The `placeholder` factory receives a new object with exactly `item`, `visual`, `box` and `rect`, built once per activation.** At `3084191bb` it receives the operation's `LiftedDrag`, which the type accepts because it has those members too. At runtime the consumer can then call `requestCancel`, `requestStep`, `translate` and `use`, and can read sortable's operation `state`. A factory that keeps its argument also keeps the operation. `freeDrag` already keeps this boundary: `home`, `onStart`, `onMove` and `onDrop` each receive an object of their own. Under CONTRIBUTING §9 the object's reason is that boundary, and it costs one allocation per activation. The contract's public surface now states the rule for every option callback.
- **`items()` is copied at every pull.** The owner withdrew the copy's removal, and `d4286ce64` restores it in `#pull`. CONTRIBUTING §9 names this ownership reason: the snapshot must stay stable when the consumer changes its own array. For example, a consumer updates its model in `onReorder`, and an `Escape` then cancels before the verdict. The landing then reads home from the snapshot. The getter API stays. DRI-14 and the `items` documentation now say that the library copies the array and the consumer keeps ownership. **No test witnessed the copy at `3084191bb`, so its removal passed the suite.** The handoff adds a witness.

**Reconciled with `DRD-20`.** Each factory still builds one module-private instance and returns a separate controller object whose methods don't depend on `this`. The step handed to the kernel, `behavior.invalidate`, is created once per instance. **`moveTo`'s step per call is confirmed**, which answers the remediation report's §Step 2. DRI-8 names it as the case that keeps call order.

## Owner decisions

None blocks the remediation. Each has a default the handoff builds.

#### DRO-1 — Press cost under CONTRIBUTING §0

**Default: pull at admission.** The prototype's press at 2,000 items cost about 440 µs more script than at 20, once per press with no layout, and that figure wasn't separated from the consumer's own `[...root.children]`. **The 2026-11-06 reading separates them:** with a cached array a press costs 53 µs at 2,000 items and 55 µs at 20, so the library's own share doesn't grow. With `[...root.children]` it costs 337 µs. That is +257 µs against drag2, which doesn't pull at a press, with a floor of 223 µs. `DRD-18` adds one pull per keyboard command and none per press. **Recommendation: approve.** The growth is the consumer's `items()`, which a consumer can cache. The alternative is a cached membership check at the press, which adds a cache and a miss path.

#### DRO-2 — A landing can be clipped

**Default: DRD-10.** An item released outside a scrolling list slides back clipped by it, and can pass under a later positioned panel, for the length of the landing. Holding the top layer removes this and brings the costs in DRD-10. **Recommendation: keep the default.** Say so if the clipped flight is unacceptable once you see it, because the change is contained in the lift and `sortable`.

#### DRO-3 — Real devices

**Default: Chromium's emulated touch runs in the suite, and physical touch and pen are stated as unverified.** The implementer has no hardware. **Recommendation: try one touch device and one pen before calling the package released.** The case most likely to differ is `pointercancel` from touch scrolling. **If a touch list that also scrolls can't be dragged there, activation by a long press becomes a feature decision.** The package has no activation by time (`DRD-17`).

#### DRO-4 — Costs measured after remediation

**Default: none is accepted until you read it.** The remediation report gives, under the rules fixed in `DRD-22`:

- the per-cycle time against both before arms, which the 2026-11-06 rounds show as probably 10 to 13 % slower at 20 items;
- the size and move cost of the class restructure alone (`DRD-20`);
- the size of the remediation as a whole, with causes.

A row that is still slower comes with its attributed cause. You decide under CONTRIBUTING §0 whether to accept it or have it removed. **No recommendation until the figures exist.**

**After `3084191bb`:** the remediation report's readings measured `b91db2818`. `3084191bb` and the composition handoff change the kernel and both built-ins, so those readings describe only `b91db2818`. A size figure the implementer saw on the uncommitted tree after `3084191bb` is not recorded, and isn't a reading. A figure offered for this decision names the commit it measured.

#### DRO-5 — Keep `599684791` reachable after the squash merge

**The repository allows only squash merges, so `main` won't contain `599684791`.** Once `drag/production` is squashed and its branch deleted, the commit stays reachable only through another ref. On 2026-11-07 that ref is `origin/drag/prototype`, whose tip `a1d31e0d2` descends from `599684791`. `origin/drag/production` holds it too, but merging normally deletes that branch. The `compare` instrument's prototype arm and `measure.ts --prototype` read the commit with `git archive`, and fail without it.

**Default: keep `drag/prototype` as the ref that preserves it.** No tag and no settings change is needed.

- **Before merge:** `git branch -r --contains 599684791` must list `origin/drag/prototype`.
- **While either instrument names the commit:** don't delete, rewrite or force-push `drag/prototype`.
- **On a checkout of `main` alone,** which includes a single-branch clone: run `git fetch origin drag/prototype` before either instrument.

**The alternative is to retire the prototype arm** from both instruments before merge, after the remediation's validation has read it. The branch then stops mattering, and the 2026-11-06 and remediation readings keep the arm's figures. **Recommendation: keep the branch until the owner has read `DRO-4`, then decide whether to retire the arm.**
