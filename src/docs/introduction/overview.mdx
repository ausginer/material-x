# Material X

Material X is a framework-agnostic design system implemented with Web
Components and aligned to Material Design 3 Expressive.

## Audience

These docs are written for adopters integrating Material X into product
applications.

## What You Get

- Installation and usage guidance for vanilla and React environments.
- Component API references generated from source types and templates.
- Theming and CSS custom property guidance.
- Accessibility caveats and behavior deltas from Material 3.

## Principles

- **Source-driven docs**: API tables are generated from exported TypeScript
  types and template anatomy.
- **M3-mapped**: every component links to relevant Material 3 pages.
- **Delta-first**: any intentional divergence from M3 is documented explicitly.

## Component Coverage

Public component docs currently cover:

- Buttons (`mx-button`, `mx-icon-button`, `mx-link-button`,
  `mx-split-button`, `mx-switch-button`, `mx-switch-icon-button`)
- Groups (`mx-button-group`, `mx-connected-button-group`)
- `mx-fab`
- `mx-icon`
- `mx-text-field`
- `mx-multiline-text-field`
