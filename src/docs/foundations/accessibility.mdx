# Accessibility

Material X components prioritize native semantics where possible, then layer in
ElementInternals and ARIA forwarding.

## General Guidance

- Prefer native labels or explicit `aria-label`/`aria-labelledby`.
- Keep switch-style controls controlled by app state.
- Ensure grouped controls have a group label.
- Validate with keyboard-only and assistive technology testing in your app.

## Known Component Caveats

- Switch components emit activation events and rely on consumers to update
  `checked`.
- Button group hosts should always provide accessible naming attributes.
- Text fields should always receive meaningful label content.
